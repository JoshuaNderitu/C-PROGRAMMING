**C Programming – Advanced Concepts & Cybersecurity Path 🔥**

Master the real power of C: pointers, memory, data structures, OS internals, networking, and hacking fundamentals.
This repository is your personal C Mastery Roadmap, containing folders for each topic, with dedicated READMEs and code examples.

**⭐ What This Repo Is About**

This repo documents your journey from intermediate C programming to low-level mastery, focusing especially on:

Deep C internals

Memory & pointer manipulation

Manual data structures

System & Linux programming

Networking

Cybersecurity + exploit development

Real-world projects for mastery

Every concept gets its own folder with:

✔ Detailed README
✔ Example code
✔ Mini projects
✔ Notes on common pitfalls

**🚀 Roadmap Overview**
**🔥 1. Master Pointers & Memory Deeply**
Learn:

Pointer arithmetic

Arrays vs pointers

const pointers

Function pointers

malloc, calloc, realloc, free

Stack vs Heap memory layout

Dangling pointers, leaks, double frees

Implementing your own dynamic arrays

**📌 Project**

🔧 Build your own realloc-like function + fully custom dynamic array library.

**🧵 2. Strings & Buffer Manipulation**
Study:

strcpy, strncpy, strcat, strcmp

Buffer overflows

Off-by-one errors

Null termination mechanics

Optional: Manual UTF-8 parsing

**📌 Project**

🔧 Implement your own strtok or a lightweight custom string parser.

**🌲 3. Build Data Structures in Pure C**
Implement:

Linked list

Doubly linked list

Stack

Queue

Hash table

Binary Search Tree

Min/max heap

Graph (adjacency list)

****📌 Project****

🧠 Build an in-memory database using your own data structures.

**📁 4. File I/O & OS Interaction**
Learn:

fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose

Working with binary files

UNIX file permissions

Pipes

Reading CLI arguments

Reading system information

**📌 Project**

📊 Create a log analyzer or key-value storage engine.

**⚙️ 5. The Build System — Become a Pro**
Learn:

How linking truly works

Essential flags: -Wall, -Wextra, -pedantic

Header files

Static libraries (.a)

Shared libraries (.so)

Makefiles (multi-file builds)
**
📌 Project**

🏗️ Create your own reusable C library and build a multi-file project around it.

**🐞 6. Debugging Tools (Critical for Cybersecurity)**
Master:

gdb

Breakpoints

Step-through debugging

Inspecting registers

Backtraces

Reading segmentation faults

Core dump analysis

**📌 Project**

💥 Write a program that intentionally crashes via buffer overflow, then debug it.

**🐧 7. Linux System Internals**
Study:

Processes

Signals

fork()

exec()

Threads & mutexes

Virtual memory

/proc filesystem

Scheduling

strace and syscalls

**📌 Project**

🖥️ Build a small shell (myshell) that runs commands.

**🌐 8. Networking in C**
Learn:

TCP/UDP sockets

Binding, listening, accepting

Client/server architecture

Packet structure

Simple HTTP parsing

📌 Project

🌍 Create a tiny C web server that can serve basic pages.

**🔓 9. Cybersecurity & Exploit Development**
Study:

Buffer overflow exploitation

Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)

Stack smashing

ASLR

NX bit

Format string vulnerabilities

Race conditions

Privilege escalation basics

**📌 Project**

🧨 Build intentionally vulnerable programs and write exploits for them.
